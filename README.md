# Bathroominator

Has a teacher ever made you fill out a bathroom pass but you were dying to go? Have you ever seen the crumbled-up paper in your school's hallways?  Well, this is the solution to your struggles!!! 
## Inspiration

I always need to use the bathroom during class. My school, however, requires a pass anytime a student goes out of the classroom. I've had some close calls when it comes to filling that out. I have also noticed an abundance of litter on the hallway floors with these passes. So taking that aspect of a school saves students time and resources. 
## What it does
It takes information from the student and then displays the pass that is used. 
## How we built it
I used some basic HTML5 and CSS. I created the form to be user-friendly so students are able to use it with no problems.
## Challenges we ran into
I had very little time(school and a family event) to practically do anything so I had to create a mock-up of what my idea was.
## Accomplishments that I am proud of
With the very little amount of time I had, I used it wisely. I didn't get to show my full skillset but nonetheless, I am proud of what I made.
## What I learned
I haven't done any prior hackathons. So this overall was definitely a learning experience for me.
